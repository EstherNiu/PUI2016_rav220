Working with Victor (vsg247) and Adrian (akd361), we found a study which applied a chi square test on catgorical variables.  We debated on which type the depended variable was and agreed it was categorical.  The variable derives its proportions based on counts which, in turn, is based on an intrinsically imprecise measure of aggressive behavior.
