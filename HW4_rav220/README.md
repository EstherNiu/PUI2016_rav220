Assignment 2

Worked with Victor (vsg247) and Adrian (akd361). We found a study which applied a chi square test relating to catgorical variables.  We debated on the dependent variable type and all agreed it was categorical.  It is one based on counts from which the variable derives its proportions.  In turn, the counting data is based on the intrinsically imprecise measure of aggressive behavior.
