Working with Victor (vsg247) and Adrian (akd361), we found a study which applied a chi square test on catgorical variables.  The paper seeks to determine whether there is, in horses, a link between chronic pain to aggressive behavior.

We debated on the type of depended variable and agreed it is categorical.  It's a proportion variable which derives from counts (which I assume is effectively of a binomial type (1 or 0)).  It may also be wothwhile to note that, in this study, the "distance" between a "1" and "0" can differ from one observation to another given the intrinsically imprecise way a count value is dermined (ie, the measurement of aggression).
